Big Class offers a variety of free, innovative programs that provide under-resourced students, ages 6-18, with opportunities to explore their creativity and improve their writing skills. We also aim to help teachers get their classes excited about writing. Our services are structured with the understanding that great leaps in learning can happen with one-on-one attention and that strong writing skills are fundamental to future success. With this in mind, we run a writing studio on St. Claude Ave. in the 9th Ward that hosts free workshops and an after-school program, Open Studio.
