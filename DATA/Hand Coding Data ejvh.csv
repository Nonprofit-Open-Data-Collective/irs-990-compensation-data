In late August and September, students will participate in the microfarms by learning standards-based curriculum in the classroom reinforced with hands-on soil preparation and planting of vegetables.The families of students and the community in general will be encouraged to participate in microfarm maintenance and in the harvesting of the fresh produce.

The unique value it creates, is that we are exposing them to ideas and possibilities to realize their hopes and dreams and ignite inspiration's they did not know existed. OWH supports STEM through its Television Broadcast Digital Arts Training program,","Founded in 2006 Overcomers with Hope Studios, Inc. trains multi-cultural, economically underserved youth ages 13 - 18 in the Digital Media Arts to realize their creative voices, overcome behavioral challenges, explore career options and contribute to their communities. The specific purpose of Overcomers With Hope is to give these low-income, at risk and disadvantage youth a second chance to live a first-class life. Participants engage in a year-round schedule of basic and advanced technology training; collaborative and individual media projects that promote a greater understanding of local and global issues; self-directed interactive learning, and field internships. The program is designed to give participants the fundamentals of goal setting, problem solving, and team collaborative. The program gives young people hands-on experience in the television broadcast digital arts media industry. The objective is not only focused on enabling the youth to secure employment, but also provide direction and hope. OWH is designed to offer new and enlightening options in addition to stopping the violence. This is accomplished through developing a weekly televised show and on-site interviews with other young people in the community. Should program participants continue in media industry or any industry sector, they are assisted throughout their application process to reach their goal through college or vocational training. We believe that when young people are given the space, support, and skills to articulate how they see themselves and the world around them, they learn to think in new ways, learn to challenge dominant view points, and learn to interact with a world larger than the confines of their neighborhoods. Most importantly, through media-making, youth move beyond being social service consumers and become conscious creators of their own personal and social agendas Life skills training is a core element of the program. Participants are schooled in written and verbal communication skills, core financial skills and positive behavioral patterns. In 2010, a nutritional program for the students was also implemented. The goal is to touch positively every aspect of their lives, with media being the exciting means to motivate and capture their attention and dedication. Program instructors/mentors introduce participants to industry standards through practical application preparing them for internships, employment opportunities; assist them in securing grants, scholarships and to imbue them with the knowledge that they can become writers, producers, directors, performers and entrepreneurs in the television or any industry and in any occupation of their desire. Students are also required to participate in community service activities. Overcomers With Hope promotes self-esteem to inspire and ignite their innate spirit to help at risk youth fulfill their hopes, dreams and ultimately become productive citizens in our community. Our intent is to transform lives and provide possibilities they never dreamed existed. OWH training consists of 2- 26-week open entry program divided into 13-week sessions. Program hours are from 5-7PM Tuesday & Thursday and 10am - 2pm on Saturday, year-round. These hours allow young adults not in school to receive training as well as accommodating high school students to come to participate during after school hours.Local television newscasters, industry professionals will assist in the training, instructing and evaluating the students along with local television professional videographers. Students will be involved in the production of a local show called ""Wake-up Oakland"" that will be live streamed. They will be part of the production team in front of and behind the camera as well as in the control room and editing process. This is a focal point of measurement as each area is monitored by a trained industry professional. Program instructors/mentors introduce participants to industry standards through practical application preparing them for internships, employment opportunities; assist them in securing grants, scholarships and to instill them with the knowledge that they can become writers, producers, directors, performers and entrepreneurs in the television or any industry and in any occupation of their desire. Students are also required to participate in community service activities. OWH has the privilege of observing young men and women evolve their sense of self, community coupled with the excitement embedded in digital media; giving way to a holistic process of cognitive and creative growth and thinking which is often missing in the lives of ,very often, exceptionally talented youth. It is the deep belief of OWH Studios that every youth should be afforded their opportunity and/or moment to shine. It is the experience of OWH Studios that the complex experience of media production often affords this moment; a wake-up moment. OWH Studios gives our students the un-surpassed power of radio, TV, movies, broadcast journalism, YouTube, Face Book, My Space and the World Wide Web. Our curriculum includes afterschool mentoring and training, exclusive news and information gathering with extended days on Saturdays. To compete in our technological world our youth must be armed with S.T.E.M (Science, Technology, Engineering Math) skills. U.S. News & World Report's that encouraging youth from underserved, low-income communities to engaged in STEM based learning helps provide a conduit for the nation's future STEM workforce. It's been noted that a digital media background is considered a STEM field and a gateway to many careers including: Aeronautics, Animation, Architecture, Auto Design, Digital Publishing, Entertainment & Amusement Parks, Film/Video, Forensics, Furniture Design, Journalism,, Law, Medical Imaging, Marketing/Advertising, Molecular Biology, Music/Recording, Real Estate, Sound Design, Stage and Set Design, Training/HR, Travel Tourism, Web Creations& Design, Nutrition, Counseling, After School Tutoring, Life Skills, Entrepreneurship OWH Studios is developing partnerships with local tech companies to provide employable positions STEM trained candidates.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
