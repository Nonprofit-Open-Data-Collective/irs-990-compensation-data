Better data means better research. 

The Aspen Institute has been instrumental in [advocating for better data](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/House-Bill-Would-Require/243152) and [promoting the work of open data](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/open-nonprofit-data-opens-doors-for-researchers/).

Many people and groups have worked hard to make [IRS 990 e-filing](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/proposed-nonprofit-form-990-e-filing-requirement-can-benefit-nonprofits-and-their-funders) possible, [new data sources](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/filling-gaps-nonprofit-data) accessible, and [new partnerships](https://registry.opendata.aws/irs990/) productive. 

Schedule H data available here has been *liberated* from AWS through the support of the Watts College of Public Service at Arizona State University.
