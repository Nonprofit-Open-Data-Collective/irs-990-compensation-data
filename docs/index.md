## Raw Data Problems 

**Unstructured Text**

**Poorly-Structured Codes**





## Data Enrichment

* Transformation of unstructured titles into a coherent taxonomy 
* Job titles parsed into roles (hierarchy) and responsibilities (domains )  
* Raw name text parsed into structured fields 
* First, middle and last names disambiguated
* Gender coding 
* Synthetic IDs
